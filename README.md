# Mini C Compiler
This project simulates a compiler and runtime environment for the Mini C language. Using JFlex, there is a lexical analyzer which checks for lexical errors, and BYaccJ allows for bottom up parsing to check for syntax and semantic errors. If the file has no errors, the file will "run" using the simulation from the addresses.
